#ScrabbleCheat
<i>This README was updated as of shaw 9a378828.</i>

The goal of the project is to create 
an algorithm to solve scrabble plays. 
A user will be prompted three times. First: 
to enter the letters currently available on the 
tileboard. Second: to enter one possible connecting 
letter. And third: to enter a string with however many
"Premium Letter Squares" and "Premium Word Squares"
are within range, along with the relative (+ of -) indexes
of each, and their type. The algorithm returns a list of 
possible words, sorted according to their point value.
